        <h1>INSPIRATION</h1>
        <br>
        <p>

His intent was to craft a narrative that would furnish solace and encouragement to youth undergoing similar trials. He desired to convey that it's perfectly acceptable to be muddled and to falter along the way. The overarching message is to persevere steadfastly and never relinquish the pursuit of one's dreams. And the people who want to learn even if they have reading difficulties, He wrote this story because he wanted to show the world or to show the universe rather that we can learn something as long as we don’t lose hope.

        <h1>LESSON</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Books are totally useless unless you take their advice. If you just keep reading them, thinking..
"Ohh that's so insightful! that changes everything," but never actually doing anything different, then pretty quickly the feeling will wear off and you'll start searching for another book to fill the void. Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying. The embrace of confusion and the acceptance of errors are part and parcel of the human experience. The paramount message is to persist unyieldingly and steadfastly nurture one's dreams.
